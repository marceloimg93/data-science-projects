# About This

This repo is for hosting Jupyter Notebooks problem resolutions for to the course [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). More specifically, Course #10 - [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) which the focus is to apply machine learning techniques to predict if a future SpaceX rocket launch will succeed in returning stage 1 rocket back to a landing site.
